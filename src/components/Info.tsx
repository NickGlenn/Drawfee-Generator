            This tool was created for the fans of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/drawfee" target="_blank">Drawfee</a>, and the <a href="/v1">original version</a> was even featured in 2 different episodes. The original version stated how many combinations there were, because the math was easy, but this version uses a more complex solution for generation with nested resolvers for placeholder replacement.
